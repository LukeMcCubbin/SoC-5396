# SoC-5396

Final Project overview 

I would like to create a system that uses the switches to create a full range of notes that can be played and heard by connecting a speaker to the audio output jack of the board. I would like to display the octave and key being used on the seven-segment display and also use the LED's to indicate which switch is on. I can also use the push-buttons to increase or decrease octaves. I would like to make the notes more realistic sounding by creating an ADSR envelope for the note emitted.
