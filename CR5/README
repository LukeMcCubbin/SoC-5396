This class report focuses on the practical implementation of I2C functionality and the use of a seven-segment display in a hardware configuration project. Beginning with the hardware setup in Vivado, specific slots are allocated for I2C (slot 10) and the LED multiplexer (seven-segment display, slot 8), with additional slots designated for UART and GPI. Following the export of the bitstream file, the coding phase in Vitis uses the main_test_sampler.cpp file, which has tests for the seven-segment display and the ADT7420 thermometer.

The ADT7420 test function employs UART communication to observe the temperature values via the serial COM port. This function uses I2C, receiving information bytes from the ADT7420 and converting them into a float corresponding to the measured temperature. A new function is created and is called temp_sseg. This function replicates the ADT test code's functionality while incorporating features for switch input and seven-segment display integration.

The conversion of temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit is determined by the status of switch 1. When the switch is on, the seven-segment displays the temperature in Fahrenheit, and when off, it displays the temperature in Celsius, using the conversion formula F = 9/5*C + 32. The display of numeric values on the seven-segment display involves multiplying the float temperature by 100. The individual digits are extracted using a for loop, employing modulus and division operations, and are displayed on the seven-segment with a decimal point at position 2.
